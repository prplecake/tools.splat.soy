# Access Token Generator for Pleroma instances

Helps generate an access token, client id, and client secret for all
that API fun.

I have a hosted instance located at
<https://tools.splat.soy/pleroma-access-token>. It's also available on
GitHub Pages: <https://prplecake.github.io/pleroma-access-token/>
